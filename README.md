# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
Overview

This project analyzes the Telco Customer Churn dataset sourced from Kaggle to understand customer attrition patterns and identify key drivers of churn.

The objective is to simulate how a telecom company would use data analytics to monitor churn rate, measure revenue at risk, segment customers by tenure and value, and design data-driven retention strategies.

The project integrates Python for data preprocessing, SQL for business problem analysis, and Power BI for dashboard visualization.

Analytical Scope

The project includes the following analytical components:

Overall churn rate calculation

Contract-wise churn comparison

Tenure-based churn segmentation

Revenue at risk estimation

Payment method impact on churn

Value vs Risk segmentation

CLV and average tenure comparison

Advanced SQL techniques applied:

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Conditional segmentation logic

Churn rate calculations

Ranking functions

Key Business Insights

A significant portion of churn occurs among month-to-month contract customers.

Early-tenure customers show the highest churn probability.

Higher monthly charge customers tend to churn more frequently.

A measurable percentage of total revenue is directly exposed to churn risk.

Business Objective

To identify high-risk customer segments and revenue exposure so that targeted retention strategies, pricing adjustments, and contract restructuring can be implemented.
